# 🏴‍☠️ Treasure Island – Python Adventure Game

## 📌 Overview
**Treasure Island** is a fun, text-based adventure game written in Python.  
The player makes choices at different stages of the story, and each decision  
leads to a different outcome — some safe, some dangerous, and some ending  
in finding the hidden treasure!

This project is perfect for beginners learning about conditional statements  
(`if`, `elif`, `else`) and building interactive command-line programs.
